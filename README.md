Full BLURN multitool source code for Gray Hack 

# MADE BY Lemming from GenericSec
Will update one day when less work and more time. Feel free to branch out and have some fun if you have edits/additions.

If a scripting rework (or some other random roadblock) breaks stuff while I'm away and triage is necessary: 
Fire off an email with a description of the issue, along with a full breakdown of what you were doing at the time and list of steps leading up to the problem. 
Target IP, the IP of the system you're attacking from, and screenshots will be helpful for diagnosing bugs if you can share them. 
A list of any other functions you've used after starting a fresh instance of blurn will also help. As will a list of open programs.
Every step you document that led to your particular problem will go a long way towards successful troubleshooting :D

You can find me at the GenSec Discord server - Ask Deckard for an invite in the main GH Discord server if you need one. Email is only a last resort, please.
